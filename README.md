# Reignite

Reignite is a prototype system for preserving user intent,
reasoning, and workflow continuity across interruptions in AI-assisted
multi-step tasks.

## Core Idea
This system models work as an evolving process rather than static content,
allowing users to resume complex workflows with full situational awareness.
